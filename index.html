            <p class="p-tag">In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism. The word diet
                often implies
                the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often
                being related).</p>

            <p>Although one might think lemons to be acidic because of their sharp and sour taste, this
                citrus fruit
                actually has an incredible alkalizing effect on the body. This is great for the health of our liver,
                which in turns aids digestion, boosts metabolism and burns fat while we sleep.</p>
